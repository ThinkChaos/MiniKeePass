        <h1>Autofill</h1>
        
        <p>If you bought the In-App-Purchase you can now use Autofill to quickly get your passwords anywhere.<br/>
        To do that follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the settings app and into &quot;Passwords &amp; Accounts&quot; and make sure that KeePass Touch is checked for AutoFill</li>
            <li>Open the main KeePass Touch app and open the database you wanna use autofill data from.</li>
            <li>Go to any app or browser and open a website with a login form or any login form in the app.</li>
            <li>Your keyboard should make suggestions to fill the login form. If they doesn't, select the key-symbol and choose &quot;KeePass Touch...&quot; and pick your entry yourself.</li>
            <li>If you want Autofill to work better, please make sure that your database entries contain a URL of the app / website domain.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        <!-- Put the part to turn of autofill here soon -->
